# Sharing NVIDIA AgentIQ Components

Every AgentIQ component is an AgentIQ plugin and is designed to be sharable with the community of AgentIQ
developers. Workflows and functions are by far the most common AgentIQ components, however that is not a comprehensive
list. In fact, this list includes all pieces that leverage an AgentIQ registration decorator
(e.g. `register_function`, `register_llm_client`, `register_evaluator`, etc.). This guide will discuss the requirements
for developing registered components that can be shared, discovered, and integrated leveraged with any AgentIQ
application.

## Enabling Local and Remote Discovery
The first step in building a sharable components is their implementation. The implementation is composed of two
key elements: 1) the configuration object as described in
[Customizing the Configuration Object](../concepts/workflow-configuration.md#workflow-configuration), and 2) the
implementation, as described in
[Create and Customize AgentIQ Workflows](../guides/create-customize-workflows.md).
This section emphasizes the details of configuration objects that facilitate component discovery.

After installing the AgentIQ library, and potentially other AgentIQ plugin packages, a developer may want to know what
components are available for workflow development or evaluation. A great tool for this is the `aiq info components` CLI
utility described in [Components Information](../concepts/cli.md#components-information). This command produces a
table containing information dynamically accumulated from each AgentIQ component. The `details` column is sourced from
each configuration object's docstring and field descriptions. Behind the scenes, these data (and others) are aggregated
into a component's `DiscoveryMetadata` to enable local and remote discovery. This object includes the following key
fields:

- `package`: The name of the package containing the AgentIQ component.
- `version`: The version number of the package containing the AgentIQ component.
- `component_type`: The type of AgentIQ component this metadata represents (e.g. `function`, `llm`, `embedder`, etc.)
- `component_name`: The registered name of the AgentIQ component to be used in the `_type` field when configuring a
workflow configuration object.
- `description`: Description of the AgentIQ component pulled from its config objects docstrings and field metadata.
- `developer_notes`: Other notes to a developers to aid in the use of the component.

For this feature to provide useful information, there are a few hygiene requirements placed on AgentIQ component
configuration object implementations.

1. Specify a name: This will be pulled into the `component_name` column and will be used in the `_type` field of a
workflow's configuration object.
2. Include a Docstring: This information is pulled into the `description` column to describe the functionality of the
component.
3. Annotate fields with [`pydantic.Field`](https://docs.pydantic.dev/2.9/api/fields/#pydantic.fields.Field): This
information is pulled into the `description` and provides developers with documentation on each configurable field,
including `dtype`, field description, and any default values.

The code sample below provides a notional registered function's configuration object that satisfies with these
requirements.

```python
from pydantic import Field

from aiq.data_models.function import FunctionBaseConfig

class MyFnConfig(FunctionBaseConfig, name="my_fn_name"):  # includes a name
    """The docstring should provide a description of the components utility."""  # includes a docstring

    a: str = Field(default="my_default_value", description="Notational description of what this field represents")  # includes a field description
```

By incorporating these elements, the `description` field in the `aiq info components` provides the following
information:

```bash
                                                                                        AgentIQ Search Results

└────────────────────────┴────────────────────────┴────────────────┴─────────────────────────┴────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Without satisfying these requirements, a developer would need to inspect the each component's source code to identify
when it should be used and its configuration options. This significantly reduces developer velocity.

## Package Distribution

After completing AgentIQ development of component plugin, the next step is to create a package that will allow the
plugin to be installed and registered with the AgentIQ environment. Because each AgentIQ plugin package is a pip
installable package, this process it is straightforward, and follows standard Python `pyproject.toml` packaging steps.
If you are unfamiliar with this process, consider reviewing the [Python Packaging User Guide](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/writing-pyproject-toml/).

When building the `pyproject.toml` file, there are two critical sections:

1. Dependencies: Ensure you include the necessary AgentIQ dependencies. An example is provided below:

    ```
    dependencies = [
    "aiq[langchain]",
    ]
    ```
2. Entrypoints: Provide the path to your plugins so they are registered with AgentIQ when installed.
An example is provided below:
    ```
    [project.entry-points.'aiq.components']
    aiq_notional_pkg_name = "aiq_notional_pkg_name.register"
    ```

### Building a Wheel Package

After completing development and creating a `pyproject.toml` file that includes the necessary sections, the simplest
distribution path is to generate a Python wheel. This wheel can be distributed manually or published to a package repository such as [PyPI](https://pypi.org/).
The standard process for generating a Python wheel can be followed as outlined in the
[Packaging Python Projects] (https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/packaging-projects/) guide.

While simple, this process does not take advantage of the `DiscoveryMetadata` to enable remote component discovery.

### Publish to a Remote Registry

Alternatively, AgentIQ provides an extensible interface that allows developers to publish packages and their
`DiscoveryMetadata`  arbitrary remote registries. The benefit of this approach comes from improved utilization of
captured `DiscoveryMetadata` to improve discovery of useful components.

By including this additional metadata, registry owners are empowered to extend their search interface and accelerate the
process of discovering useful components and development of AgentIQ based applications.

### Share Source Code

The last option for distribution is through source code. Since each AgentIQ package is a pip installable Python package,
each can be installed directly from source. Examples of this installation path are provided in the
[Get Started](../intro/get-started.md) guide.

## Summary

There are several methods for component distribution, each of which depends on constructing a pip installable Python
packages that point to the hygienic implementations of component plugins. This lightweight, but extensible approach
provides a straightforward path for distributing AgentIQ agentic applications and their components to the developer
community.
