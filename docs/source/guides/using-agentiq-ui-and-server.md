# Using the NVIDIA AgentIQ User Interface and API Server
AgentIQ provides a user interface for interacting with your running workflow.

There are currently four workflow transactions that can be initiated using HTTP or WebSocket when the AgentIQ server is
running: `generate non-streaming`,`generate streaming`, `chat non-streaming`, and `chat streaming`. The following are types of interfaces you can use to interact with your running workflows.
  - **Generate Interface:** Uses the transaction schema defined by your workflow. The interface documentation is accessible
    using Swagger while the server is running [`http://localhost:8000/docs`](http://localhost:8000/docs).
  - **Chat Interface:** [OpenAI API Documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/text?api-mode=chat) provides
    details on chat formats compatible with the AgentIQ server.

## User Interface Features
- Chat history
- Interact with Workflow via HTTP API
- Interact with Workflow via WebSocket
- Enable or disable Workflow intermediate steps
- Expand all Workflow intermediate steps by default
- Override intermediate steps with the same ID

### Generate Non-Streaming Transaction
- **Route:** `/generate`
- **Description:** A non-streaming transaction that waits until all workflow data is available before sending the
result back to the client. The transaction schema is defined by the workflow.
- HTTP Request Example:
  ```bash
  curl --request POST \
    --url http://localhost:8000/generate \
    --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --data '{
      "input_message": "Is 4 + 4 greater than the current hour of the day"
    }'
  ```
- **HTTP Response Example:**
  ```json
  {
    "value":"No, 4 + 4 is not greater than the current hour of the day."
  }
  ```
### Generate Streaming Transaction
  - **Route:** `/generate/stream`
  - **Description:** A streaming transaction that allows data to be sent in chunks as it becomes available from the
    workflow, rather than waiting for the complete response to be available.
- HTTP Request Example:
  ```bash
  curl --request POST \
    --url http://localhost:8000/generate/stream \
    --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --data '{
      "input_message": "Is 4 + 4 greater than the current hour of the day"
    }'
  ```
- HTTP Intermediate Step Stream Example:
  ```json
  "intermediate_data": {
    "id": "ba5191e6-b818-4206-ac14-863112e597fe",

### Choosing between Streaming and Non-Streaming
Use streaming if you need real-time updates or live communication where users expect immediate feedback. Use non-streaming if your workflow responds with simple updates and less feedback is needed.

## Walk-through
In this walk-through, we will guide you through the steps to set up and configure the AgentIQ user interface. Refer to `examples/simple_calculator/README.md` to set up the simple calculator workflow demonstrated in the following walk-through properly.


The AgentIQ UI is located in a git submodule at `external/agentiq-opensource-ui`. Ensure you have checked out all of the
git submodules by running the following:
```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### Start the AgentIQ Server
You can start the AgentIQ server using the `aiq serve` command with the appropriate configuration file.

```bash
aiq serve --config_file=examples/simple_calculator/configs/config.yml
```
Running this command will produce the expected output as shown below:
```bash
2025-03-07 12:54:20,394 - aiq.cli.commands.start - INFO - Starting AgentIQ from config file: 'examples/simple_calculator/configs/config.yml'
WARNING:  Current configuration will not reload as not all conditions are met, please refer to documentation.
INFO:     Started server process [47250]

INFO:     Application startup complete.
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://localhost:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

### Verify the AgentIQ Server is Running
After the server is running, you can make HTTP requests to interact with the workflow.

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url http://localhost:8000/generate \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
    "input_message": "Is 4 + 4 greater than the current hour of the day?",
    "use_knowledge_base": true
}'
```

Running this command will produce the following expected output:
**Note:** The response depends on the current time of day the command executes.
```bash
{
  "value": "No, 8 is less than the current hour of the day (4)."
}
```

### Launch the AgentIQ User Interface
After the AgentIQ server starts, launch the web user interface. Launching the UI requires that Node.js v18+ is installed. Instructions for downloading and installing Node.js can be found in the official documentation [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download).

```bash
cd external/agentiq-opensource-ui
npm install
npm run dev
```
After the web development server starts, open a web browser and navigate to [`http://localhost:3000/`](http://localhost:3000/).
Port `3001` is an alternative port if port `3000` (default) is in use.

![AgentIQ Web User Interface](../_static/ui_home_page.png)

### Connect the User Interface to the AgentIQ Server Using HTTP API
Configure the settings by selecting the `Settings` icon located on the bottom left corner of the home page.

![AgentIQ Web UI Settings](../_static/ui_generate_example_settings.png)

#### Settings Options
**Note:** It is recommended to select /chat/stream for intermediate results streaming.
- `Theme`: Light or Dark Theme.
- `HTTP URL for Chat Completion`: REST API enpoint.
  - /generate
  - /generate/stream
  - /chat
  - /chat/stream
- `WebSocket URL for Completion`: WebSocket URL to connect to running AgentIQ server.
- `WebSocket Schema` - Workflow schema type over WebSocket connection.

### Simple Calculator Example Conversation
Interact with the chat interface by prompting the Agent with the
message: `Is 4 + 4 greater than the current hour of the day?`

![AgentIQ Web UI Workflow Result](../_static/ui_generate_example.png)

## AgentIQ API Server Interaction Guide
A custom user interface can communicate with the API server using both HTTP requests and WebSocket connections.
For details on proper WebSocket messaging integration, refer to the [WebSocket Messaging Interface](../references/websockets.md) documentation.
