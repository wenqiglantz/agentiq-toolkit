# Welcome to the NVIDIA AgentIQ Documentation

AgentIQ is a flexible library designed to seamlessly integrate your enterprise agents—regardless of framework—with various data sources and tools. By treating agents, tools, and agentic workflows as simple function calls, AgentIQ enables true composability: build once and reuse anywhere.

## Key Features

- [**Framework Agnostic:**](./concepts/plugins.md) Works with any agentic framework, so you can use your current technology stack without replatforming.
- [**Reusability:**](./guides/sharing-workflows-and-tools.md) Every agent, tool, or workflow can be combined and repurposed, allowing developers to leverage existing work in new scenarios.
- [**Rapid Development:**](./guides/create-customize-workflows.md) Start with a pre-built agent, tool, or workflow, and customize it to your needs.
- [**Profiling:**](./guides/profiler.md) Profile entire workflows down to the tool and agent level, track input/output tokens and timings, and identify bottlenecks.
- [**Observability:**](./guides/observe-workflow-with-phoenix.md) Monitor and debug your workflows with any OpenTelemetry-compatible observability tool.
- [**Evaluation System:**](./guides/evaluate.md) Validate and maintain accuracy of agentic workflows with built-in evaluation tools.
- [**User Interface:**](./guides/using-agentiq-ui-and-server.md) Use the AgentIQ UI chat interface to interact with your agents, visualize output, and debug workflows.
- [**MCP Compatibility**](./components/mcp.md) Compatible with Model Context Protocol (MCP), allowing tools served by MCP Servers to be used as AgentIQ functions.

With AgentIQ, you can move quickly, experiment freely, and ensure reliability across all your agent-driven projects.
