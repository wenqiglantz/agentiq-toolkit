# AgentIQ Examples

Each AgentIQ examples demonstrates a particular feature or use case of the AgentIQ library. Most of these contain a custom [workflow](../docs/source/guides/create-customize-workflows.md) along with a set of custom tools ([functions](../docs/source/concepts/functions.md) in AgentIQ). The examples can we used as a starting off point for creating your own custom workflows and tools. Each example contains a `README.md` file that explains the use case along with instructions on how to run the example.

To run the examples, you need to install AgentIQ from source. For more information on installing AgentIQ from source, if you have not already done so follow the instructions in [Install From Source](../docs/source/intro/install.md#install-from-source) .
