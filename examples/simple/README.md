# A Simple LangSmith-Documentation Agent

A minimal example demonstrating a simple LangSmith-Documentation agent. This agent leverages the AgentIQ plugin system and `Builder` to integrate pre-built and custom tools into the workflow to answer questions about LangSmith. Key elements are summarized below:

## Table of Contents

* [Key Features](#key-features)
* [Installation and Usage](#installation-and-setup)
* [Deployment-Oriented Setup](#docker-quickstart)

---

## Key Features

- **Pre-built Tools:** Leverages core AgentIQ library tools.
- **Custom Plugin System:** Developers can bring in new tools using plugins.
- **High-level API:** Enables defining functions that transform into asynchronous LangChain tools.
- **Agentic Workflows:** Fully configurable via YAML for flexibility and productivity.
- **Ease of Use:** Simplifies developer experience and deployment.

---

## Installation and Setup

If you have not already done so, follow the instructions in the [Install Guide](../../docs/source/intro/install.md) to create the development environment and install AgentIQ.

### Install this Workflow:

From the root directory of the AgentIQ library, run the following commands:

```bash
uv pip install -e examples/simple
```

### Set Up API Keys
If you have not already done so, follow the [Obtaining API Keys](../../docs/source/intro/get-started.md#obtaining-api-keys) instructions to obtain an NVIDIA API key. You need to set your NVIDIA API key as an environment variable to access NVIDIA AI services:

```bash
export NVIDIA_API_KEY=<YOUR_API_KEY>
```

### Run the Workflow

Run the following command from the root of the AgentIQ repo to execute this workflow with the specified input:

```bash
aiq run --config_file examples/simple/configs/config.yml --input "What is LangSmith?"
```

**Expected Output**

```console
$ aiq run --config_file=examples/simple/configs/config.yml --input "What is LangSmith"

Final Answer: LangSmith is a platform for LLM (Large Language Model) application development, monitoring, and testing. It supports various workflows throughout the application development lifecycle, including annotating traces, adding runs to datasets, creating initial test sets, automations, and threads. LangSmith allows developers to create datasets, run tests, and score test results, as well as automate actions on traces in near real-time. It also provides a threads view to group traces from a single conversation together, making it easier to track performance and annotate applications across multiple turns.

## Docker Quickstart

Prior to building the Docker image ensure that you have followed the steps in the [Installation and Setup](#installation-and-setup) section, and you are currently in the AgentIQ virtual environment.

Set your NVIDIA API Key in the `NVIDIA_API_KEY` environment variable.

```bash
export NVIDIA_API_KEY="your_nvidia_api_key"
```

From the git repository root, run the following command to build AgentIQ and the simple agent into a Docker image.

```bash
docker build --build-arg AIQ_VERSION=$(python -m setuptools_scm) -f examples/simple/Dockerfile -t simple-agent .
```

Then, run the following command to run the simple agent.

```bash
docker run -p 8000:8000 -e NVIDIA_API_KEY simple-agent
```

After the container starts, you can access the agent at http://localhost:8000.

```bash
curl -X 'POST' \
  'http://localhost:8000/generate' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"input_message": "What is LangSmith?"}'
```
