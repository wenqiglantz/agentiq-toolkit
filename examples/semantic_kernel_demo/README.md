# Semantic Kernel Example

A minimal example using Semantic Kernel showcasing a multi-agent travel planning system where an Itinerary Agent creates a travel schedule, a Budget Agent ensures cost compliance, and a Summarizer Agent formats the final itinerary. **Please note that we only support OpenAI models currently**.

## Installation and Setup

If you have not already done so, follow the instructions in the [Install Guide](../../docs/source/intro/install.md) to create the development environment and install AgentIQ.

### Install this Workflow:

From the root directory of the AgentIQ library, run the following commands:

```bash
uv pip install -e examples/semantic_kernel_demo
```

### Set Up API Keys

You need to set your OpenAI API key as an environment variable to access OpenAI AI services:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=<YOUR_API_KEY>
```

## Adding Long-Term Memory

 With AgentIQ, adding Long Term Memory (LTM) is as simple as adding a new section in the configuration file.

Once you add the LTM configuration, export your Mem0 API key, which is a prerequisite for using the LTM service. To create an API key, refer to the instructions in the [Mem0 Platform Guide](https://docs.mem0.ai/platform/quickstart).

Once you have your API key, export it as follows:

```bash
export MEM0_API_KEY=<YOUR_MEM0_API_KEY>
```

Then, you can run the workflow with the LTM configuration as follows:

```bash
aiq run --config_file examples/semantic_kernel_demo/configs/config.yml --input "Create a 3-day travel itinerary for Tokyo in April, suggest hotels  within a USD 2000 budget. I like staying at expensive hotels and am vegan"
```

**Expected Output**
The workflow produces a large amount of output, the end of the output should contain something similar to the following:

```console

Please note that it is normal to see the LLM produce some errors on occasion as it handles complex structured tool calls. The workflow will automatically attempt to correct and retry the failed tool calls.

Assuming we've successfully added our preference for vegan restaurants in the last prompt to the agent, let us attempt to retrieve a more personalized itinerary with vegan dining options:

```bash
aiq run --config_file examples/semantic_kernel_demo/configs/config.yml --input "On a 1-day travel itinerary for Tokyo in April, suggest restaurants I would enjoy."
```

**Expected Output**
