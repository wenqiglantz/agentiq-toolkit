# A Simple Plot Chart Agent

A minimal example demonstrating an E2E chart plotting agentic workflow fully configured by a YAML file. This workflow leverages the AgentIQ plugin system and `Builder` to integrate pre-built and custom tools into the workflow. Key elements are summarized below:

## Table of Contents

* [Key Features](#key-features)
* [Installation and Usage](#installation-and-setup)
* [Example Usage](#example-usage)

## Key Features

- **Pre-built Tools:** Leverages core AgentIQ library tools.
- **Custom Plugin System:** Developers can bring in new tools using plugins.
- **High-level API:** Enables defining functions that transform into asynchronous LangChain tools.
- **Agentic Workflows:** Fully configurable via YAML for flexibility and productivity.
- **Ease of Use:** Simplifies developer experience and deployment.

## Installation and Setup

### Setup Virtual Environment and Install AgentIQ

If you have not already done so, follow the instructions in the [Install Guide](../../docs/source/intro/install.md) to create the development environment and install AgentIQ.

### Install this Workflow:

From the root directory of the AgentIQ library, run the following commands:

```bash
uv pip install -e examples/plot_charts
```

### Set Up API Keys
If you have not already done so, follow the [Obtaining API Keys](../../docs/source/intro/get-started.md#obtaining-api-keys) instructions to obtain an NVIDIA API key. You need to set your NVIDIA API key as an environment variable to access NVIDIA AI services:

```bash
export NVIDIA_API_KEY=<YOUR_API_KEY>
```

## Example Usage

### Run the Workflow

Run the following command from the root of the AgentIQ repo to execute this workflow with the specified input:

```bash
aiq run --config_file examples/plot_charts/configs/config.yml  --input "make a line chart for me"
```

**Expected Output**

```console

Note: in this run, the image is saved to **./USA vs EMEA Data by Year.png** in the root folder of the AgentIQ repository. Depending on the input, your run might have a different image name, please check the **`bot_message`** output to find the image.



Note: this is a multi-agents system, you can also try out some other examples listed below :
```bash
aiq run --config_file examples/plot_charts/configs/config.yml  --input "no I change my mind, make a bar chart instead"
```
```bash
aiq run --config_file examples/plot_charts/configs/config.yml  --input "tell me a joke"
```


### Launch the Workflow Server

Run the following command from the root of the AgentIQ repo to serve this workflow:

```bash
aiq serve --config_file examples/plot_charts/configs/config.yml
```

**Expected Output**

```console
INFO:     Started server process [162278]
INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
Starting up
/home/coder/dev/ai-query-engine/examples/plot_charts/src/plot_charts/create_plot.py:10: LangChainDeprecationWarning: As of langchain-core 0.3.0, LangChain uses pydantic v2 internally. The langchain_core.pydantic_v1 module was a compatibility shim for pydantic v1, and should no longer be used. Please update the code to import from Pydantic directly.

For example, replace imports like: `from langchain_core.pydantic_v1 import BaseModel`
with: `from pydantic import BaseModel`
or the v1 compatibility namespace if you are working in a code base that has not been fully upgraded to pydantic 2 yet.         from pydantic.v1 import BaseModel

  from .plot_chain_agent import PlotChartAgents
INFO:     Application startup complete.
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

**Triggering the Workflow Server**

The workflow server can be triggered using the following curl command from another terminal:

```bash
curl --request POST   --url http://localhost:8000/generate   --header 'Content-Type: application/json'   --data '{"input_message": "make a trend chart for me"}'
```

**Expected Output**
```json
{"value":"Saved output to ./USA vs EMEA Performance Over Time.png"}
```

Find the image in the root folder of the AgentIQ repository with the image name displayed above
