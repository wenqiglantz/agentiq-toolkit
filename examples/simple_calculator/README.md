# A Simple LLM Calculator

This example demonstrates an end-to-end (E2E) agentic workflow using the AgentIQ library, fully configured through a YAML file. It showcases the AgentIQ plugin system and `Builder` to seamlessly integrate pre-built and custom tools into workflows.

## Key Features

- **Pre-built Tools:** Leverages core AgentIQ library tools.
- **Custom Plugin System:** Developers can bring in new tools using plugins.
- **High-level API:** Enables defining functions that transform into asynchronous LangChain tools.
- **Agentic Workflows:** Fully configurable via YAML for flexibility and productivity.
- **Ease of Use:** Simplifies developer experience and deployment.

## Installation and Setup

If you have not already done so, follow the instructions in the [Install Guide](../../docs/source/intro/install.md) to create the development environment and install AgentIQ.

### Install this Workflow:

From the root directory of the AgentIQ library, run the following commands:

```bash
uv pip install -e examples/simple_calculator
```

### Set Up API Keys
If you have not already done so, follow the [Obtaining API Keys](../../docs/source/intro/get-started.md#obtaining-api-keys) instructions to obtain an NVIDIA API key. You need to set your NVIDIA API key as an environment variable to access NVIDIA AI services:

```bash
export NVIDIA_API_KEY=<YOUR_API_KEY>
```

## Example Usage

This example makes use of [Arize Phoenix](https://docs.arize.com/phoenix) to visualize the traces generated by the workflow.

### Run Phoenix

Open a new terminal, source the virtual environment and run `phoenix serve` to capture traces.

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
phoenix serve
```

### Run the Workflow

Return to your original terminal, and run the following command from the root of the AgentIQ repo to execute this workflow with the specified input:

```bash
aiq run --config_file examples/simple_calculator/configs/config-tracing.yml --input "Is the product of 2 * 4 greater than the current hour of the day?"
```

**Expected Output**
The workflow output can be quite lengthy, the end of the workflow output should contain something similar to the following (the final answer will depend on the time of day the workflow is run):
```console
The agent's thoughts are:
Thought: I now know the final answer

Final Answer: No, the product of 2 * 4 (which is 8) is less than the current hour of the day (which is 13).
2025-03-04 13:25:03,419 - aiq.observability.async_otel_listener - INFO - Intermediate step stream completed. No more events will arrive.
2025-03-04 13:25:03,419 - aiq.front_ends.console.console_front_end_plugin - INFO - --------------------------------------------------
Workflow Result:
['No, the product of 2 * 4 (which is 8) is less than the current hour of the day (which is 13).']
--------------------------------------------------
```

### Examine the Traces in Phoenix
Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:6006` to view the traces.

## Deployment-Oriented Setup

For a production deployment, use Docker:

### Build the Docker Image

Prior to building the Docker image ensure that you have followed the steps in the [Installation and Setup](#installation-and-setup) section, and you are currently in the AgentIQ virtual environment.

From the root directory of the Simple Calculator repository, build the Docker image:

```bash
docker build --build-arg AIQ_VERSION=$(python -m setuptools_scm) -t simple_calculator -f examples/simple_calculator/Dockerfile .
```

### Run the Docker Container
Deploy the container:

```bash
docker run -p 8000:8000 -p 6006:6006 -e NVIDIA_API_KEY simple_calculator
```

Note, a phoenix telemetry service will be exposed at port 6006.

### Test the API
Use the following curl command to test the deployed API:

```bash
curl -X 'POST' \
  'http://localhost:8000/generate' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"input_message": "Is the product of 2 * 4 greater than the current hour of the day?"}'
  ```

  ### Expected API Output
  The API response should be similar to the following:

```bash
{
  "input": "Is the product of 2 * 4 greater than the current hour of the day?",
  "output": "No, the product of 2 * 4 (which is 8) is less than the current hour of the day (which is 16)."
}
```
