"question": "What are LLMs",
"answer": "LLMs stand for Large Language Models, which are a type of machine learning model designed for natural language processing tasks such as language generation. They are trained with self-supervised learning on a vast amount of text and can acquire predictive power regarding syntax, semantics, and ontologies inherent in human language corpora.",
"generated_answer": "A large language model (LLM) is a type of machine learning model designed for natural language processing tasks such as language generation. LLMs are language models with many parameters, and are trained with self-supervised learning on a vast amount of text. They are useful for a variety of tasks, including speech recognition, machine translation, natural language generation, optical character recognition, route optimization, handwriting recognition, grammar induction, and information retrieval."

"question": "who was Djikstra?",
"answer": "Djikstra was a Dutch computer scientist, programmer, software engineer, mathematician, and science essayist. He is best known for his work on the shortest path problem and his development of Dijkstra's algorithm, which is used to find the shortest path between nodes in a weighted graph.",
"generated_answer": "'Edsgar Djikstra was a Dutch computer scientist, programmer, software engineer, mathematician, and science essayist who made significant contributions to the field of computer science, including the development of the shortest path problem and the first compiler for the programming language ALGOL 60. He was awarded the 1972 Turing Award for his fundamental contributions to developing structured programming languages and received the ACM PODC Influential Paper Award in distributed computing for his work on self-stabilization of program computation."

"question": "what is the goldilocks zone?",
"answer": "The Goldilocks zone, also known as the habitable zone, is the region around a star where temperatures are just right for liquid water to exist on a planet's surface. It is called the Goldilocks zone because it is neither too hot nor too cold, but just right, much like the porridge in the children's story \"Goldilocks and the Three Bears\".",

It is called the Goldilocks zone because it is neither too hot nor too cold, but just right, much like the porridge in the children\\'s story \"Goldilocks and the Three Bears\". The concept of the Goldilocks zone is important in astrobiology and the search for extraterrestrial life, as it is believed that life can only exist on planets that are within this zone"
