# Tool Calling Agent

A configurable Tool Calling Agent. This agent leverages the AgentIQ plugin system and `WorkflowBuilder` to integrate pre-built and custom tools into the workflow. Key elements are summarized below:

## Key Features

- **Pre-built Tools:** Leverages core AgentIQ library agent and tools.
- **Tool Calling / Function calling Agent:** Leverages tool / function input schema to appropriately route to the correct tool
- **Custom Plugin System:** Developers can bring in new tools using plugins.
- **High-level API:** Enables defining functions that transform into asynchronous LangChain tools.
- **Agentic Workflows:** Fully configurable via YAML for flexibility and productivity.
- **Ease of Use:** Simplifies developer experience and deployment.

## Installation and Setup

If you have not already done so, follow the instructions in the [Install Guide](../../../docs/source/intro/install.md) to create the development environment and install AgentIQ.

### Install this Workflow:

From the root directory of the AgentIQ library, run the following commands:

```bash
uv pip install -e .
```

The `code_generation` and `wiki_search` tools are part of the `agentiq[langchain]` package.  To install the package run the following command:
```bash
# local package install from source
uv pip install -e '.[langchain]'
```


### Set Up API Keys
If you have not already done so, follow the [Obtaining API Keys](../../../docs/source/intro/get-started.md#obtaining-api-keys) instructions to obtain an NVIDIA API key. You need to set your NVIDIA API key as an environment variable to access NVIDIA AI services:

```bash
export NVIDIA_API_KEY=<YOUR_API_KEY>
```
---

## Run the Workflow

The Tool Calling Agent can be used as either a workflow or a function, and there's an example configuration that demonstrates both.
If youâ€™re looking for an example workflow where the Tool Calling Agent runs as the main workflow, refer to [config.yml](configs/config.yml).
To see the Tool Calling Agent used as a function within a workflow, alongside the Reasoning Agent, refer to [config-reasoning.yml](configs/config-reasoning.yml).
This README primarily covers the former case, where the Tool Calling Agent functions as the main workflow, in config.yml.
For more details, refer to the [ReAct Agent documentation](../../../docs/source/components/tool-calling-agent.md) and the [Reasoning Agent documentation](../../../docs/source/components/react-agent.md)

Run the following command from the root of the AgentIQ repo to execute this workflow with the specified input:

```bash
aiq run  --config_file=examples/agents/tool_calling/configs/config.yml --input "who was Djikstra?"
```

**Expected Output**

```console
$ aiq run  --config_file=examples/agents/tool_calling/configs/config.yml --input "who was Djikstra?"

Workflow Result:
['Edsger Wybe Dijkstra was a Dutch computer scientist, programmer, software engineer, mathematician, and science essayist. He is best known for his work on the shortest path problem, which he solved in 1956, and for his development of the first compiler for the programming language ALGOL 60. Dijkstra was also a pioneer in the field of computer science, and his work had a significant impact on the development of the field. He was awarded the Turing Award in 1972 for his contributions to the development of structured programming languages.']
