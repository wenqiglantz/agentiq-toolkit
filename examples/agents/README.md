# Agent Examples

The agent examples demonstrate how AgentIQ accelerates and enables AI Agent development.
The examples showcase 5 distinct AI Agent architectures solving a similar problem in different ways.
By leveraging AgentIQâ€™s plugin system and the `Builder` object, we can utilize both pre-built and custom agentic workflows and tools in a flexible manner.


1. [ReAct Agent Example](./react/configs/config.yml)
2. [ReAct Agent + Reasoning Agent Example](./react/configs/config-reasoning.yml)
3. [Tool Calling Agent Example](./tool_calling/configs/config.yml)
4. [Tool Calling Agent + Reasoning Agent Example](./tool_calling/configs/config-reasoning.yml)
5. [Mixture of Agents Example](./mixture_of_agents/configs/config.yml) - A ReAct Agent calling multiple Tool Calling Agents
